							<p>I immigrated to the United States at the age of 5 and I have been in the Bay Area ever since. 
								I graduated from San Francisco State University with a degree in Biology concentrated in Physiology.
								I got my first full time job working at Passport Capital, an investment firm, as the assistant to the General Counsel, 
								as well as prior to that I worked at a personal injury law firm.
								Originally, I wanted to pursue a career in healthcare or law.</p>
							<p>But then I was introduced to Lambda School and decided to go for a career change. 
							I knew learning how to code in Silicon Valley would create more opportunities for me and finding a job I would be happy doing.
							And that is how I got back to being a student again.
